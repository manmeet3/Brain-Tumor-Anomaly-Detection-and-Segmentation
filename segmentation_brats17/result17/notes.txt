use CBICA_ABH file for showing a relatively normal scan.
Refer to segmentation_brats17_inference colab for showing one with a large ssegmentation area.

These 2 are the demo files. Have some other ones pre-processed ready to show

Create a microservice that does inference based on an input file path and dumps output to same file path.
Web service should then store the output file into its DB and display that any time the URL is visited following initial processing.

In the inference microservice, instantiate all the networks at startup, read file from disk based on inference request message and process the file (on GPU this should hopefully take 30 sec - 1 minute)
